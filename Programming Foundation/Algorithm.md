# Algorithm

## Given an array with integers of length 6. Write a bubble sort algorithm to arrange the integers from smallest to largest.

- Step 1: Start
- Step 2: Starting with the first element of the array, compare the current element with the next element
bubbleSort(array)
- Step 3: If curent element > Next element, Swap them
- Step 4: If current element < Next element, Move to next element and repeat Step 2.
- Step 5: Stop if after iterating through the whole array and no swap is done.
- Step 6: Stop.
